# Completion Report

This report summarizes the current implementation status of each Gradle submodule and the overall test/quality posture.

## Scope
- **Unit tests**: run with `./gradlew test` (excludes `@Tag("integration")`)
- **Integration tests**: run with `docker-compose up -d && ./gradlew integrationTest && docker-compose down`
- **Coverage**: `./gradlew jacocoRootReport` → `build/reports/jacoco/jacocoRootReport/html/index.html`

## Module Status (20 modules)

### Core & Runtime
- `core`: ✅ API abstractions complete; unit coverage maintained.
- `runtime`: ✅ Redis-backed runtime (Redis Streams) with in-process parallelism, stop-the-world checkpoint (experimental), Redis keyed state, watermark/timers/window support; plus minimal in-memory runtime for tests/examples.

### Infrastructure
- `mq`: ✅ Redis Streams MQ with partitions, consumer groups, retry/DLQ, retention & ACK policy (see `docs/retention-and-ack-policy.md`).
- `registry`: ✅ Service registry/discovery with health checks, metadata filtering, load balancing.
- `config`: ✅ Redis-based configuration service with versioning, listeners, history retention.
- `state`: ✅ Redis-backed state primitives (Value/Map/List/Set).
- `checkpoint`: ✅ Coordinator + storage; unit + integration coverage.

### Stream Semantics & Operators
- `watermark`: ✅ Watermark strategy + generators.
- `window`: ✅ Window assigners + triggers (runtime currently uses assigners; trigger execution is not fully wired).
- `aggregation`: ✅ Window aggregator + PV/UV/TopK + quantiles (rolling-window).
- `table`: ✅ KTable/KGroupedTable (InMemory + Redis-backed).
- `join`: ✅ Time-window stream-stream join.
- `cep`: ✅ PatternSequenceMatcher with quantifiers/contiguity/within constraints.

### Connectors & Integration
- `source`: ✅ Kafka/HTTP/Redis sources (unit tests; Kafka via mock consumer).
- `sink`: ✅ Kafka/Redis sinks (unit tests; Kafka via mocked producer).
- `reliability`: ✅ Retry policies/executor, DLQ services, deduplication, rate-limiters.
- `metrics`: ✅ Prometheus exporter + collectors.
- `spring-boot-starter`: ✅ Auto-configuration + operational housekeepers + service registration.
- `examples`: ✅ Example apps; excluded from publishing/coverage aggregation.

## Known Constraints / Non-Goals (current)
- `runtime` is intentionally minimal and single-process: designed for deterministic tests and lightweight examples.
- Integration tests require Redis; they are excluded from `test` by design and must be run via `integrationTest`.
